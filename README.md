The Splitter app is a convenient tool for calculating and splitting bills or expenses among a group of people. 

1. The Splitter app simplifies the process of dividing expenses among friends, roommates, or colleagues, ensuring a fair and accurate distribution of costs when at a restaurant.
2. To use the Splitter app, enter the total bill amount and the percentage of tip (the tip is calculated based on the bill) and the number of people sharing the expenses.
3. The app will automatically calculate and display the amount each person needs to contribute, making it easy to settle bills and avoid any misunderstandings or disputes.
4. With the Splitter app, you can save time and effort in splitting expenses, ensuring everyone pays their fair share and maintaining financial harmony within the group.

Why I chose React?
I chose React to develop this project because of its component-based architecture, which allows for reusable code. React's virtual DOM efficiently updates and renders changes, resulting in fast and performant user interfaces. The extensive React ecosystem provides a wide range of libraries and community support. Additionally, React's declarative syntax and JSX make it intuitive and easy to write and understand code.

I chose Vite as the build tool for this project due to its lightning-fast development server and quick startup times. Vite leverages native ES modules to provide instantaneous module replacement,speeding up the development process. Vite's straightforward configuration and compatibility with modern web standards made it a perfect fit for the React project, enhancing productivity and developer experience.
